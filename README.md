This repository is for social platform where users can view posts from other users. 
Implementation information.
Question 1 

Implement a web-based client application for the platform using data from the JSON placeholder mock API with the following requirements: 

An anonymous or free user can view up to 20 posts per day for free in a page/section/tab labeled “Feed”. If they exceed their free limit, a paywall should appear. 
A login using their username or email and zip-code as their password. For example, user with id=1 should be able to log in with “Bret” and “92988-3874” as their password 
In addition to (1) above, an authenticated user can view their profile, logout and also view their posts in a dedicated “My posts” page/section/tab. 
An authenticated user can pay for premium membership (mock payment) and are now able to view all posts (100). 
An authenticated user can follow other users from a list of all users (10), and can now view all friends posts in a page/section/tab labeled “Following” 
A premium user can block a single post or all posts from a particular user. 
Requirements: The app must be mobile-friendly and adhering to UI/UX best practices. All data operations must be on the JSON placeholder API. You are free to use any language/framework. (20 Marks) 

Question 2
Build on your implementation above. This is an open-ended question and you are free to implement more features on the platform as well as build on top of the existing features. You are encouraged to integrate other services using third-party providers. Here are a couple of examples to give you an idea of what we are looking for: 
You can build on the payment feature by adding payment services via mobile money, cards, etc. 
You can build on posts; add likes, comments, view count, search, Ad space in feed, recommendation algo, etc. 
You can add push notifications for new posts, a direct message feature, etc. 
You can add AI for post-composition assistance, profile picture generation, etc.
